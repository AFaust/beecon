Years later it is sometimes stil astounding how little people know about that feature and how few people actively use it. Considering the spotty documentation and bad experiences with performance that float around / are passed along in the community, it is high time to look at this feature a bit more closely. This talk will provide a general overview of transactional metadata query functionality and showcase example use cases. In some cases proper use of transactional metadata queries may necessitate small changes to data modelling or logic, and this talk will list common considerations. Lastly, we will look at typical issues with query performance and how these can be dealth withor avoided.</p>",

He is responsible for principal technical decisions during planning. So, if something goes wrong in the wild - non-standard setup is required or Alvex does not work on the latest Alfresco release - it is also Alexey's headache. Prior to ITD Systems he worked for VDEL as consultant and presale team lead helping partners and customers to build solutions based on open source technologies. Alexey has a Ph.D. in Mathematical Modeling, Numerical Methods, and Software Complexes from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.",
