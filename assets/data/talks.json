	"abstract": "Building a single content platform for few dozens quite loaded applications is a complex task. It becomes even worse, if application developers are not sure about expected load and content structure in the next few years. This talk concentrates on two aspects of this challenge.<br/><br/>* Clustering and sharding - different solutions for different problems. Sharding Alfresco - reasons and implementation. Building federation proxy to aggregate multiple independent Alfresco repositories and provide a single API entry point on top of them. Live technical experience only - issues, solutions, limitations, lessons learned. Live benchmark data included.<br/><br/>* Handling complex search queries on top of sharded installation. A lot of search use cases are not covered with out of the box flat SOLR indexing. Sometimes users need to search complex nested objects, not just files. (It's more or less about indexing associations - 'I'd like to find all cases (node A), created by the company (node B) with name matching this, and containing child documents (nodes C) registered not later than that date' - it's quite hard to match this query having only nodes properties in the index.) We implemented an external SOLR Cloud integrated with sharded Alfresco installation to serve such complex search requests using custom indexing logic based on SOLR nested objects. In this talk we will cover reasons for such custom indexing architecture, and share an experience of its implementation.<br/><br/>Bonuses:<br/>* Short live demo - Share UI on top of sharded Alfresco<br/>* Call for community participation - let's turn this experience into open source project<br/>",

It will look at a sub-set of use cases that are supported by or that members of the community have implemented on top of Aikau, and review the advantages and potential short-comings of the framework in that context.

However straightforward this requirement, the technical implementation is often a challenge since these applications all require specific front-end customisations. When deploying multiple customized Share front-end for these business applications, some aspects such as workflows, dashboards, etc. cannot be easily separated.<br/><br/>One option is building your front-end applications from scratch, but that ignores the wealth of functionality that is available in Share out-of-the-box. Moreover some organizations already use Share as a front-end and would like to keep a consistent experience for their users.<br/><br/>In this talk we share our experience on using multiple customized Share instances as business application front-end on the same Alfresco repository. Some potential pitfalls when developing such solutions are:<br/><br/>* The use of specific personal dashboards for each application, which conflicts with the current single dashboard configuration within Alfresco<br/><br/>* The definition of application-specific workflows, which conflicts with Shareâ€™s default behavior of showing all defined workflows<br/><br/>* Out-of-the-box dashlets whose queries are not limited to your application scope.<br/><br/>* â€¦<br/><br/>This talk will give an overview of some of the more dangerous pitfalls we encountered, how we solved them and what best practices to keep in mind.<br/>",

However, this logic can be really complex especially when the permissions are set at documents-level. Permissions might depend on meta-data, on external data, can be temporary, even the logic itself could change frequently.  Also, in an enterprise environment Alfresco is probably not the only application developed. You might already have business rules in place about permissions that you want to reuse. In a project at CERN, we decided to externalize all this logic in a Business Rules Engine, and then to interface it with Alfresco. <br/>",
